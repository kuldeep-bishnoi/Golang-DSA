# Golang DSA Learning Path

Welcome to your complete Golang Data Structures and Algorithms learning resource! This repository provides a structured path to master DSA concepts using Go, from basics to advanced topics.

## How to Use This Repository

This learning path is designed for both beginners and those preparing for technical interviews:

1. **Start with Fundamentals**: Begin with Introduction and Basics sections
2. **Progress Sequentially**: Follow the numbered folders in order
3. **Practice with Code**: Run and modify the code examples to solidify understanding
4. **Complete Exercises**: Tackle the practice problems at the end of each section
5. **Review Interview Questions**: Study the common interview questions for each topic

## Learning Path

### Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- **01_Introduction**: Programming basics, Go syntax, environment setup
- **02_Basics**: Variables, types, control flow, functions in Go

### Core Data Structures (Weeks 3-5)
- **03_Arrays**: Array operations, multi-dimensional arrays
- **09_Linked_Lists**: Singly, doubly, circular linked lists  
- **10_Stacks_Queues**: Stack and queue implementations

### Searching & Sorting (Weeks 6-7)
- **04_Searching**: Linear search, binary search
- **05_Sorting**: Bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick, heap sort

### Problem-Solving Techniques (Weeks 8-9)
- **06_Strings**: String manipulation, pattern matching
- **07_Recursion_Backtracking**: Recursive patterns, backtracking

### Advanced Data Structures (Weeks 10-12)
- **11_Trees**: Binary trees, BST, AVL trees, heaps, tries
- **12_Graphs**: Graph representations, traversals, shortest paths

### Go-Specific Topics (Throughout)
- **08_OOP**: Object-oriented programming concepts in Go

## For Each Topic You'll Find

1. **Conceptual Explanation**: Simple, visual explanations of each concept
2. **Go Implementation**: Clean, well-commented code examples
3. **Time & Space Complexity**: Analysis of algorithmic efficiency
4. **Common Patterns**: Recurring problem-solving strategies
5. **Interview Questions**: Frequently asked questions with solutions
6. **Practice Problems**: Additional exercises to build proficiency

## Study Plan

### Daily Practice (30-60 minutes)
- Read the topic explanation
- Study and run the code examples
- Modify the code to test your understanding

### Weekly Goals
- Complete 1-2 topics each week
- Solve 5-10 related practice problems
- Implement 1 small project using the concepts learned

### Monthly Review
- Revisit previous topics to reinforce learning
- Take practice assessments to identify weak areas
- Refactor previous solutions with more efficient approaches

## Interview Preparation

Each topic includes a section dedicated to technical interview preparation:
- Common interview questions
- Problem-solving approaches
- Optimization techniques
- Edge cases to consider
