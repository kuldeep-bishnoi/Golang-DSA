## Time & Space Complexity Analysis

### Big O Cheat Sheet

| Complexity | Name        | Example                                |
|------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| O(1)       | Constant    | Map/array access, stack push/pop       |
| O(log n)   | Logarithmic | Binary search, balanced BST operations |
| O(n)       | Linear      | Linear search, array traversal         |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic| Merge sort, quicksort (avg)            |
| O(nÂ²)      | Quadratic   | Nested loops, bubble sort              |
